# MTHE272
Final code relating to MTHE 272 truss animation project
Running the "Animation.m" file will display real-time calculations of internal forces in a truss as an applied force moves.
Once all forces have been calculated, an animation will run at a smooth frequency to show changes in forces within the truss.
